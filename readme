These scripts are designed to constitute a pipeline which begins with raw VLA observation data and eventually produces science-ready data products, particularly star formation rates of the given target galaxies. The primary goal of this project is to attain star formation rates (SFRs) for each of the target galaxies, which can then be analyzed and compared to SFRs previously attained through infrared and optical study. 

The project is broken up into five major components.

1. Generate scripts which will image the raw VLA data, as well as perform other CASA commands on said images : generate_cleans.py

Raw interferometric data comes in the form of visibilites, which must be Fourier transformed and "cleaned" to yield an useful image. Here, the "tclean" algorithm in CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) is used to perform these tasks. Because there are upwards of 20 target galaxies, and because CASA commands cannot be imported into python, the best solution was to write a python code which would generate an imagining script for every galaxy's directory based on what is within it. 

Thus, "generate_cleans" goes to every galaxy's directory and writes a simple script which can be run in CASA, which will construct an image and clean it, as well as perform other CASA commands. It also generates an executable which will tell each of the many scripts how to run. Then, by simply running the executable, all 20+ images can be constructed and cleaned simultaneously. 

2. Measure fluxes from sources : MeasureFluxes.py

Once we have nice images to work with, we want to measure the flux density from the target galaxy, as this will enable us to calculate a SFR in step 3. 

Here we do simple aperture photometry, a circle is put down over the source, and the pixel values are summed up and normalized. This function returns a flux density, an uncertainty, and other useful parameters of the image.

3. Calculate star formation rates : CalcSFRs.py

An equation in Murphy et. al (2011) relates the non-thermal luminosity of a galaxy observed at a certain frequency to the star formation rate. Thus, if we convert our flux density to a luminosity using the inverse square law, we can calculate a star formation rate. We use the spectral luminosity distance from Condon & Matthews (2018) for the distance.

This script handles the calculation of a SFR and uncertainty.

4. Constructing a table : ConstructTable.py

Organizing all of the relevant data in an Astropy table is convenient for doing science. The data table from previous study containing SFRs from infrared and other information are appended to with our results. 

5. Make plots : MakePlots.py

Plot our 21 cm SFR vs IR SFR. Because of the FIR-radio correlation, the IR and radio SFRs should be 1:1. A linear fit to these data should provide a good metric of whether this is true in our case.
